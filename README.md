Project Description:

Our project consists of analyzing 2017 California home mortgage application data made available by the federal government under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. In particular, we are interested in looking at race/gender, location and income data segemented by loans that are originiated vs. those that are not. Additionally, we will explore, using machine leaarning models, how accurately we are able to predict whether or not a loan will be originated based on various factors that applicants provide when applying for a loan (lien status, loan amount, etc.).
